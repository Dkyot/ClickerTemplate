  message: 'The fifth circle of hell: Anger and Laziness. In a dark pool, convicts
    are constantly fighting for intemperance in anger. Bogged down naked sinners,
    choking on mud, tear each other to shreds, beat their feet and heads in fierce
    anger. Trampled into the bottom of the swamp are souls so deeply harboring hatred
    that they are only capable of despondency, laziness and sluggish boredom. Drowned
    in dark waters, they are visible only by the air bubbles that rise from their
    sighs.'
