  massege:
  - 'The first circle of hell: Limbo. After crossing the river, sinners fall into
    Limbo. Virtuous but unbaptized souls, atheists, scientists and thinkers, innocent
    people who lived before the coming of Christ, benefactors who profess other religions,
    infants who died without the rite of baptism are sent here. The dead here do
    not bear cruel punishments, but endlessly remain in limp sorrow and sorrow.'
  - 'The second circle of hell: Voluptuousness. The second circle includes people
    who, during their lifetime, uncontrollably indulged in carnal pleasures and lust.
    Men and women who have lived a life of debauchery, adultery, lust and attraction
    for whom were above morality and virtue suffer here. Crowds of souls are endlessly
    tormented by the hurricane wind. They spin, wind in a cold storm, with screams
    and moans they beat against the rocks on which Minos sits.'
  - "The third circle of hell: Gluttony. In the third circle, those convicted of
    gluttony and greed for food suffer. The guardian of the gluttonous abode is an
    evil, three\u2013headed dog Cerberus with human clawed hands. His shaggy beard
    is smeared with black grease, three mouths tear, gnaw and torment the dead."
  - 'The fourth circle of hell: Greed. The fourth circle is a haven for souls convicted
    of inability to manage money. Here, spendthrifters and misers are punished for
    the opposite sins. They are guarded by Plutos, who was once the god of wealth
    on the Greek Olympus, and then was cast into hell and turned into a demon.'
  - 'The fifth circle of hell: Anger and Laziness. In a dark pool, convicts are constantly
    fighting for intemperance in anger. Bogged down naked sinners, choking on mud,
    tear each other to shreds, beat their feet and heads in fierce anger. Trampled
    into the bottom of the swamp are souls so deeply harboring hatred that they are
    only capable of despondency, laziness and sluggish boredom. Drowned in dark waters,
    they are visible only by the air bubbles that rise from their sighs.'
  - 'The sixth circle of hell: For heretics and false teachers. Those who spread
    false teachings and heresy during their lifetime are kept here and suffer endlessly.
    Their punishment is lying in red-hot graves.'
  - 'The seventh circle of hell: For rapists and murderers of all stripes. Sinners
    are torn apart by dogs, harpies hunt them, they are boiled in scarlet boiling
    water, turned into trees and forced to run under streams of flame.'
  - 'The eighth circle of hell: For the deceived. The eighth circle of hell is a
    stone ledge in the abyss with ten circular depressions that surround the abyss
    in the center like moats. This area in hell is called Evil Crevices. The souls
    of deceivers are sent here. Each of the ten stone depressions of the eighth circle
    corresponds to one type of deception.'
  - 'The ninth circle of hell: For apostates and traitors. 9 circles of hell according
    to Dante descend to the icy lake Cocytus, where the souls of traitors who deceived
    people who trusted them go. The icy surface of the lake consists of four tapering
    rings, into which sinners are frozen up to their necks. Their faces are disfigured
    by the cold and are directed downward.'
