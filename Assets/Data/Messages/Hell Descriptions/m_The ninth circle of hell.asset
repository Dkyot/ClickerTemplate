  message: 'The ninth circle of hell: For apostates and traitors. 9 circles of hell
    according to Dante descend to the icy lake Cocytus, where the souls of traitors
    who deceived people who trusted them go. The icy surface of the lake consists
    of four tapering rings, into which sinners are frozen up to their necks. Their
    faces are disfigured by the cold and are directed downward.'
